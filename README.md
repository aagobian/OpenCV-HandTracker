# Hand Tracker

This is an older beginner OpenCV project I made that captures live video from a webcam and tracks hand movements in real-time. Using OpenCV and a hand detection model from Mediapipe, the project processes each video frame to detect and highlight the position of the user's hand. The hand is outlined or marked on the video feed, providing visual feedback on its location and movement. This setup is useful for gesture-based applications or interactive systems where hand position tracking is required.






## Installing required libraries

The required libraries are OpenCV and Mediapipe.


```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```
